# BitPacking #

An awesome Xcode 7 Playground for learning how to do work with binary data
files and how to work with strangely sized data.

## The Format ##

The data is read from a file and has a bit of a strange format. 
  1. The first 2 bytes are ignored.
  2. The next two bytes are the sequence number.
  3. Then 18 bytes of x,y,z coordinates.
